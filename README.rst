combparser
===========
This module is intended to be a user friendly library for
creating parsers in Nim. Currently it only parses strings but
the idea is to support mode kinds of input in the future.
The initial effort focused on adding better error statements
so that parsers are easier to debug.

The starting point for this library was created by kmizu:
